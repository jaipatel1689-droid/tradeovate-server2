# tradeovate-server2

## Setup
1. Node 18+ (dev is on Node v24).
2. Create `.env` from `.env.example` and fill real values locally (do **not** commit).
3. Install & run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start

# 6) Confirm the two “must-have” files are in GitHub
- `src/index.js`
- `src/lib/supabase.js`
- `src/routes/signals.js`
(Plus the other routes you have.)

# 7) Tell me “Pushed”
Once that push is live, I’ll review the repo structure, line-by-line, and prepare a clean patch (route wiring, Supabase client, schema touches, and the `sb.from` issue prevention). I’ll hand you a copy‑pasteable PR diff so you can merge locally or through GitHub in one shot.

If any push command errors out, paste the exact error and I’ll give the one‑liner to fix it.
